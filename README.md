# Ingredient-Police


Ingredient Police is a mobile app for Android that uses **Optical Character Recognition** and **Web Scraping** to enable users to better understand the nutritional drawbacks of foods they eat. Built in Java, Ingredient Police provides intuitive usability and versatility to enable the user to get the most out of the app.

# Value
What makes this app so great is that it even works when the phone is __asleep/out of focus of the app__. Leveraging the [**PocketSphinx**](https://pypi.org/project/pocketsphinx/) API by Carnegie Mellon researchers, iHearU is able to parse sound passively and trigger when it hears the set keyword.

# Purpose
The main goal of this app is to allow users a chance to call for help without notifying an assailant of their intent. For example, if the keyword they have set is "please don't hurt me", the app would send a message to emergency contacts the user selected and notify them there might be a problem. All the while, the assailant would assume the user was talking to them.

# Configurability

- The user is able to add, remove and edit their emergency contacts through the app itself.
- The user is able to set the keyword/phrase they want the app to trigger on to their needs, enabling greater usability.
- The user is able to enable/disable listening at any time with the click of a button, allowing them to manage the data that the app accesses.
